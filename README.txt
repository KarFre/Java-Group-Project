Welcome to our recreation of Hangman!

***HOW TO RUN***
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hangman runs best on the Eclipse IDE. Simply import the project file into
an Eclipse IDE with JavaFX implemented, and it should be ready to run.

***HOW TO PLAY***
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- In the first scene, you choose a word category from the drop-down box.
- Upon submission of your category, the game scene opens up, with a 
  secret word in asterisks at the bottom left of the screen.
- You enter a SINGLE ALPHABETICAL CHARACTER into the text box to make a single letter guess.
- If you would like to guess the full word at any time, you may enter your guess in the
  text box and submit using the "Guess Full Word" button. NOTE: This ends the game, no matter
  if you are right or wrong. Guess carefully!
- You can only guess incorrectly 6 times before the man is hung and you lose the game. 
- You may win the game by either guessing the full word correctly or guessing the 
  full amount of correct letters before your 6 incorrect guesses are used up. Simple!
- When you either win or lose, you will have the option to restart the game and choose
  another category.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
***ADDITIONAL NOTES***
- There is a "Help" menu on the first screen. If you click on the "About" tab, 
  you will be able to view the developer names in a window.
- In order to quit the game, you may use the x on the application window. There is no 
  in-game way to exit the game.
- The letter guessing is not case sensitive, so you may enter capital or 
  lowercase letters.
